# About Me:

Hey I'm Known I made my name a verb to confuse people, I've been a game developer for around 6 years now

I wanted to move to unity until I finally got out of the tutorial loop and actually started learning how to use my game engine (Which is Godot by the way) and I realized just how much I could actually manipulate Godot to what I needed essentially Godot is like clay and I'm the artist. I can make Godot the perfect tool for me, Especially now that I know how to create and manipulate all sorts of Godot files (like *.tscn)
Some Project I've made

## Parasitic:

In 2024 in march I made a game for the 67#  GDJ (Godot Wild Jam) [This Jam](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-67)

It was at that point that I actually started to learn my engine properly

I ranked 13th out of 151 submissions

I liked the game and will probably make another one but better, but not soon

If you do play it warning, It gets laggy after round 15 and I tried to make the game infinite but it stops after round 30

## Upcoming Projects

I am currently working on two things at the moment

The Technology Engine (TTE): I am making a game where you can build technology by placing blocks and wires, I plan on having a steam page up soon (for wishlists) and I want to have a demo here on itch.io . Since I believe on allowing people to make what they want without limit this game will be free,

Scenesheet: I'm making a Godot plugin where you can create a huge amount of scenes in bulk using graph nodes and spread sheets I want this plugin to speed up the development process of games mainly where you have to make scenes over and over again which have slight deviation from one another

And that's about it for now I'll try to keep this page updated with what I'm recently doing
